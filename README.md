# Containerd Shim Spin

This project aims to provide the [containerd shim](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/core/runtime/v2/README.md#runtime-shim) implementation for [Spin](https://developer.fermyon.com/spin), which enables running Spin workloads on Kubernetes via [runwasi](https://github.com/deislabs/runwasi). This means that by installing this shim onto Kubernetes nodes, we can add a [runtime class](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/runtime-class/) to Kubernetes and schedule Spin workloads on those nodes. Your Spin apps can act just like container workloads!

[runwasi](https://github.com/deislabs/runwasi) is a project that aims to run WASI workloads managed by [containerd](https://containerd.io/).

## Shim and Spin Version Map

Below is a table for referencing the version of the Spin runtime used in each `containerd-shim-spin` release.

| **shim version** | v0.12.0                                                       | v0.13.0                                                       | v0.14.0                                                       | v0.14.1                                                       | v0.15.0                                                       | v0.15.1    |

## Documentation

To learn more about the Containerd Shim Spin, please visit [the official Containerd Shim Spin documentation](https://www.spinkube.dev/docs/topics/architecture/#containerd-shim-spin).

## Building and running the `containerd-shim-spin` on host

Make sure you have installed dependencies:
```bash
make setup # setup linux environment
```

Build, install, and run the shim binary:

```bash
make run # run the shim binary
```

You may open another terminal and run the following command to test the shim:
```bash
curl 0.0.0.0:80/hello
```

## Installing the `containerd-shim-spin` on Kubernetes Nodes

In order to run Spin applications on your cluster, you must complete the following three steps:

1. Install the shim on each Node that should support Spin apps
2. Update the containerd configuration to recognize the shim
3. Apply the Kubernetes `RuntimeClass` for the shim

Repeating steps 1 and 2 for each node on a cluster can be a time-consuming and manual process. For this reason, SpinKube provides a [`runtime-class-manager`](https://www.spinkube.dev/docs/topics/architecture/#runtime-class-manager) (previously the `kwasm` operator) that enables you to skip over step 1 and 2. See the [SpinKube installation guide](https://www.spinkube.dev/docs/install/installing-with-helm/) for more information on installing with Helm.

To carry out the installation step-by-step, do the following:

1. Install the shim on each Node that should support Spin apps

    Install a [release of the shim](https://github.com/spinkube/containerd-shim-spin/releases) on the `PATH` of your Kubernetes worker nodes. For example, copy `containerd-shim-spin-v2` to `/bin`. Shims are additive, so once the `containerd-shim-spin` is installed on a Node, it can support Spin WebAssembly apps alongside Linux containers.

2. Add the following to the containerd config.toml that maps the runtime type to the shim binary from step 1.

    ```toml
    [plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".containerd.runtimes.spin]
    runtime_type = "io.containerd.spin.v2"
    ```

    The [Node Installer script](./node-installer/script/installer.sh) that is used by the [`runtime-class-manager`](https://www.spinkube.dev/docs/topics/architecture/#runtime-class-manager) does this for you and is a good reference to understand the common paths to the containerd configuration file for popular Kubernetes distributions.

3. Apply a runtime class that contains a handler that matches the "spin" config runtime name from step 2.

    This ensures that the image is executed with the correct runtime, namely the `containerd-shim-spin`.

    > Note: You likely want to customize the Runtime Class with a [`nodeSelector`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector) to ensure Pods are only scheduled to Nodes where the shim has been installed.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: node.k8s.io/v1
    kind: RuntimeClass
    metadata:
    name: wasmtime-spin-v2
    handler: spin

    ```

4. Deploy a Spin app to your cluster with the specified `RuntimeClass` name matching the "wasmtime-spin-v2" runtime class from step 3. The [Spin Operator](../spin-operator/_index.md) does this for you, translating `SpinApp` custom resources into Kubernetes deployments.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
    name: wasm-spin
    spec:
    replicas: 1
    selector:
        matchLabels:
        app: wasm-spin
    template:
        metadata:
        labels:
            app: wasm-spin
        spec:
        runtimeClassName: wasmtime-spin-v2
        containers:
            - name: spin-hello
            image: ghcr.io/spinkube/containerd-shim-spin/examples/spin-rust-hello:v0.13.0
            command: ["/"]
    ```
